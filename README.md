# Giphy-Project

For this project we were asked to create a themed GIPHY page, that had button options pre-set to provide 10 gifs when clicked on, using an AJAX call using the Giphy API.  Then also there needed to be an option for the user to input another search term into a text box to add a button to the screen, and then use that term in a giphy search to add to the top of the page.  Coding the HTML and css was more on the easier side as there was not much body to the page, but the jQuery and AJAX calls were definitely more complicated.  Using our past exercises from class, I was able to layout the adding of buttons and the classes and attributes that went along with them, but the most difficult part for me was the appending the 'rating' and the 'gif' to the page.  I sat with Aaron after class Monday, and we basically just re-wrote the code I had, and it worked.  Most likely there was a small typo or something that we could not find.

Then the other difficulty I found was laying out the gifs in an easier to read layout (in a table or gallery), and then the pausing and playing the gifs on click.  Basically I was able to have the gif appear on screen either animated or still, but the clicking to alternate was not working, even though when I inspected the gif added to the screen - I was able to see that it was calling both the normal gif and the still gif url.  More to come after class tomorrow..
